# Penetration Testing Project: CyberHowl Security

This project, created by **CyberHowl Security**, provides a detailed penetration testing report for multiple virtual environments. The primary objective was to identify and exploit vulnerabilities across different platforms using ethical hacking techniques. Our team set up vulnerable environments and performed penetration tests to enhance our understanding of cybersecurity and defense mechanisms.
